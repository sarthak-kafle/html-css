     <p>
        Sel Roti is a traditional homemade, sweet, ring-shaped rice bread/doughnut. My mum makes for all visits and festivals throughout Dashain and Tihar, widely celebrated Hindu festivals in Nepal.

         Today I'm sharing this very special recipe from her, it is time consuming but worth to go through all, everyone loves it. The ingredients are so simple, but my Mum makes it so special which I learnt to share this recipe with you.
